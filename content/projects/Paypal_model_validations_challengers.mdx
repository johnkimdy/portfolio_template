For my work at PayPal, as a Second Line of Defense, our usual task is to validate models built by the ML modelers in the First Line of Defense. I have listed the models I have validated and have improved as follows:

# Validation Areas

## Credit

- Business Loan Underwriting Model
- Business Loan Fraud Application Detection Model
- Buy Now Pay Later Underwriting Model

## Fraud

- Onboarding Fraud Detection Model

## Customer Complaints

- Complaints Identification Model
- Complaints Categorization Models

# Challenger Models

- Sometimes I take a long, hard look at the models that the First Line modelers have built and have a "Aha!" moment. Then I build a challenger model that can perform better.
- I currently specialize in validating and creating challenger models for PayPal Credit.
- Most common issue with the existing models I have observed so far are the quality of the model inputs, especially the lack of useful features.

  - Examples of new features I introduced:
    - Consumer-related data for business loans, and business-related data for consumer credit to improve credit risk assessment.
    - Use of alternative data, such as TELCO, macroeconomic variables, etc..

- Improvement in validation KS score from 34 to 45 for one of the challenger models.
